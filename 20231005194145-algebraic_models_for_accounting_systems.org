#+title: Algebraic Models For Accounting Systems

* Approaches to Accounting Theory
** Algebraic concepts employed
+ Balance vectors
  * A balance vector is a column vector or column matrix the sum of whose entries equals zero.
  * Balance vectors are able to represent the state of an accounting system at any instant.
  * They are also capable of encoding the transactions that are applied to the system.
    
+ Digraph
  * The vertices represent accounts and the edges indicate where there are flows
    of value within the system. Thus a digraph gives a picture of how value can
    flow around an accounting system.
+ Automaton
  * The applicability to accounting is clear: the states of the accounting
    system are the balance vectors, the inputs are the transactions and the
    outputs are the new balance vectors.
